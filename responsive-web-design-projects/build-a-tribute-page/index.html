        <h2>Some Fun Details About Savage</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We have had Savage for about six years now. He ran away when he was one-year-old and we almost lost him.</li>
          <li>Up until this year, we thought Savage was a female.</li>
          <li>Savage mostly eats lettuce.</li>
          <li>One of Savage's favorite snacks is cherry tomatoes so be careful if you have your toenails painted red and are walking near him.</li>
          <li>He will acknowledge you if you call his name and that's about the extent of his training.</li>
          <li>He is our best boy.</li>
        </ul>
